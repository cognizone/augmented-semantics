New ideas: copy them into ideas.md, remove the list here (but keep the file and the instructions) then work on them.

- label display logic (depending on languages) seems scattered? should it be in one place?
- notation of concepts in "Classification des accords sectoriels avec l'Union européenne" just show "id" as type?
- sorting tree should use the label but if there is an id in it need to use sorting based on id (numeric sorting if possible)
  if numeric sorting is not possible, use the label as a string and sort alphabetically
- readme needs tp be made github ready. this needs to include a how to run the app too
- packaging needs to be reviewed. system complains
