New ideas: copy them into ideas.md, remove the list here (but keep the file and the instructions) then work on them.

- notation of concepts in "Classification des accords sectoriels avec l'Union européenne" just show "id" as type?
- packaging needs to be reviewed. system complains
- if I click in history of recent concepts and select one it only updates the concept part. not the tree. not the concept scheme in the main top row.
- still recent concepts does not use full vertical space!!!
- we should add the type somewhere in the "main component part" (typically concept?!)
    as a side issue one we are there (in inconsistent state) we cannot select other concept scheme anymore
- is it possible to have broader and not narrower?
