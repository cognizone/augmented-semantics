New ideas: copy them into ideas.md, remove the list here (but keep the file and the instructions) then work on them.

- notation of concepts in "Classification des accords sectoriels avec l'Union européenne" just show "id" as type?
- packaging needs to be reviewed. system complains

    as a side issue one we are there (in inconsistent state) we cannot select other concept scheme anymore
