New ideas: copy them into ideas.md, remove the list here (but keep the file and the instructions) then work on them.

- notation of concepts in "Classification des accords sectoriels avec l'Union européenne" just show "id" as type?
- packaging needs to be reviewed. system complains
- still recent concepts does not use full vertical space!!!
- we should add the type somewhere in the "main component part" (typically concept?!)
    as au side issue one we are there (in inconsistent state) we cannot select other concept scheme anymore
- using endswith logic to find the properties??
- navigation to related concepts in same database should be via the tool. for example the main taxonomy + it/fr/de taxosare
- it seems that breadcrumb does not correctly refresh after selecting a search result or a recent item. it stays on the current concept scheme 
- search config icon is too big
