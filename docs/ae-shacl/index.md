- **Violation Reports** — Clear, actionable validation results
- **Fix Suggestions** — Guidance on resolving constraint violations
- **Shape Editor** — Visual interface for creating SHACL shapes
- **Bulk Validation** — Validate large datasets with progress tracking

## Use Cases

- Validating data quality before publication
- Debugging SHACL shape definitions
- Creating data entry forms from shapes
- Documenting data constraints
