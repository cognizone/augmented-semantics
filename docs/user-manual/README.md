# AE SKOS User Manual

A fast, modern browser for exploring SKOS vocabularies. Lazy-loaded trees, instant search, multilingual support, dark mode, and keyboard shortcuts — all running directly in your browser. No backend, no installation, no data leaves your machine.

## Getting Started

AE SKOS connects directly to SPARQL endpoints in your browser - no backend server required. Your data stays between you and the endpoint.

### First Launch

When you first open AE SKOS, what you see depends on how it was deployed:

| Standard Mode | Pre-configured Mode |
|---------------|---------------------|
| The Endpoint Manager opens with suggested endpoints for you to add and manage. | Endpoints are already set up by an administrator — you're ready to browse. |
